A simple mod that adds the ability to seamlessly combine Diamond and Netherite chestplates with an Elytra. No need for extra trinket slots, or pressing a button to fly, you can just simply wear both at the same time.

To craft them you'll need a new Smithing Template found in End City chests at a rate of 1/10, which can be duplicated with a similar crafting recipe to the Netherite Smithing Template from vanilla. With the Smithing Template take your Diamond or Netherite Chestplate to a Smithing table and shove in the Chestplate, the Elytra, and the Smithing Template and there you go; either a Diamond Elytra Chestplate or a Netherite Elytra Chestplate.

Through this process the enchantments from the Chestplate will be preserved on the new item and enchantments that were on the Elytra will be lost. Also, a Diamond Elytra Chestplate may be upgraded like other Diamond gear into a Netherite Elytra Chestplate through the same process as usual.

Other things to note:

* THEY CAN BREAK (Not from flight but from damage)
* Flight stops working at 10% durability left
* Fully customizable with Armor Trims
* Unbreaking reduces durability usage similar to an Elytra
